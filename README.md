## Build And Test Image

To build image, run command `docker build -t jackjiaibm/ibm-jenkins-slave-nvm .`.

To test run image, run command:

```
$ docker run --privileged jackjiaibm/ibm-jenkins-slave-nvm <public key>

# or

$ docker run -e --privileged "JENKINS_SLAVE_SSH_PUBKEY=<public key>" jackjiaibm/ibm-jenkins-slave-nvm
```

For example, use your local SSH public key:

```
$ docker run --privileged jackjiaibm/ibm-jenkins-slave-nvm "$(cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub)"
```

After the Jenkins client container is started, you can use `docker ps` find the container and user `docker exec -it -u jenkins <container-id> bash` to connect to the container.

## About Base Image

`openjdk:8-jdk` which is Debian 9 (Stretch).

This docker image is a modified version from official `jenkins/ssh-slave`, and can be used as `Connect method` - `Connect with SSH` with user `jenkins`. The modification is installing nvm before declare "VOLUME /home/jenkins", so changes done by nvm install can be saved.

## About Node Version Manager

With nvm, the jenkins user doesn't require sudo to run `npm install`. This is explanation from npmjs.org: https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/fixing-npm-permissions#option-one-reinstall-with-a-node-version-manager.
